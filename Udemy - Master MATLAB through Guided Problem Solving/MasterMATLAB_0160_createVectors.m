% make a row vector using square brackets
vectR = [1 2 3 4 5 4 3 2 1 -1 -2]

% make a column vector using semicolons
vectC = [1; 2; 3; 4; 5; -4; -3; -2; 1; 0];

% make a column vector by transposing a row vector
vectCT = [1 2 3 4 5]'

% create a 2x3 matrix
matr = [1 2 3; 4 5 6]

% or transpose a 3x2 matrix!

matrT = [1 4; 2 5; 3 6]'

% make a row vector of ones

rowV = ones(1, 11)

% column vector of .25

colV = zeros(8, 1) + .25

% matrix of random numbers
matrRand = randn(4, 5)

% transpose that matrix and store as a new matrix
